# ArtEngine

Alternative-Dimensions

Alternative-Dimensions built this repository to learn, and for fun.
The art engine has a built in function to create metadata with blockchain network metadata added, alongside randomly generating images using layers in an image to create different images.
There will be Youtube tutorials to learn how to download application, set-up application, and run application.
During my process of learning it is sometimes difficult to learn everything online as sometimes the tutors leave certain criteria and steps out.  This can make someone with now coding or programming knowledge very difficult to learn.  I hope everyone enjoys our ArtEngine, and all applications as we build our portfolio in our Development career.
